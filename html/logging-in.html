<h1>
  Logging In
</h1>

<p>
  Graffiti applications can be used without logging in, but the user will not have an identity or be able to create new content.
  To log in or out of Graffiti from a Vue app all you need to do is call <code class="language-js">$gf.toggleLogIn</code> function.
  <code class="language-js">$gf</code> is in the global Vue namespace so you can use it directly in templates or via <code class="language-js">this.$gf</code> in components.
  You can also use the longer alias <code class="language-js">$graffiti</code> if you want.
</p>

<p>
  To check whether a user is logged in, you can use the <code class="language-js">$gf.me</code> variable.
  This variable is equal to a user's unique ID if they are logged in and <code class="language-js">null</code> otherwise.
  We will come back to this variable in both <RouterLink to="/context">§Context</RouterLink> and <RouterLink to="/privacy">§Privacy</RouterLink>, but to make a basic button to log or out, we can just treat the variable as a boolean.
  For example:
</p>

<GraffitiPlayground path="log-in" />

<h2>
  Connectivity
</h2>

<p>
  In addition to actually being logged in,
  it's important to let your user know whether they're connected to the Graffiti server or not.
  You can use the reactive <code class="language-js">$gf.connected</code> to check this state.
  Check out what happens to in the demo below if you turn off your WiFi.
</p>

<GraffitiPlayground path="connected" />
