<h1>
  Implementation
</h1>

<p>
  Graffiti is currently implimented as a <em>centralized</em> system.
  We chose to make the system centralized to start in order to rapidly prototype with the API it exposes.
  Eventually we hope that the system is decentralized and end-to-end encrypted.
  We're pretty certain that both of those things are technically possible but we don't have the resources to impliment it right now.
  Very open to help.
</p>

<p>
  Graffiti currently has one client side library and it works with the Vue.JS web framework.
  There is no reason why other frameworks like React, etc. and a nice vanilla JS interface could exist.
  We just simply don't have the resources.
  Again, if you want to help out, you can contact us.
