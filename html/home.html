    lets you integrate custom social features into any static website with just a few lines of HTML and JavaScript.
    These features can be as simple as a comments sections or amount to full-fledged applications like Facebook or Google Docs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Applications within the Graffiti ecosystem also <em>interoperate</em>.
    If your friends use a Graffiti application that you don't like, you can either modify it, create your own from scratch, or switch to an application that someone else has already built &mdash; all without losing your friends!
    You can change pretty much anything including the moderation system, privacy settings, feed sorting algorithm, site layout, color scheme, etc.
