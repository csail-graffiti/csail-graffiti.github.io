  Media
</h1>

<p>
  Media in Graffiti is not stored in the server but instead served peer-to-peer over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebTorrent">WebTorrents</a>.
  You act as the server or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeding_(computing)">seed</a> of your own files and any one who views your files also becomes a seed.
</p>

<p>
  This approach means there is no perscribed limit to the number or size of files you want to share since you are the one responsible for hosting them.
  The downside is that your media files can go offline when there are no seeders online.
  We're in the process of creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox">seedboxes</a> for Graffiti content,
  but for now this is simply a limitation of alpha-stage software.
</p>

<p>
  To store media, you can use the asynchronous <code class="language-js">$gf.media.store</code> function.
  This function takes as input a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File">File</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob">Blob</a>
  and returns a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme">magnet link</a> corresponding to your file.
</p>

<p>
  To fetch media, you can use the <code class="language-js">$gf.media.fetchBlobURL</code> function 
  which takes a magnet link as input and returns a link to a local copy of the object that can be fed into the <code class="language-js">src</code> of <code class="language-html">&lt;img></code> tags, for example.
</p>

<p>
  In the example below we construct a profile creator which creates an ActivityVocabulary Profile object.
  It stores the magnet link of the uploaded file in the <code class="language-js">image</code> field and then retrieves the file at that magnet link to display the object.
