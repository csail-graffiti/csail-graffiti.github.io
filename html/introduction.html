<p>
  This guide explains how to build these web apps with the Graffiti client Javascript library and it's plugin for the Vue.js web framework.

<p>
  If you haven't yet already, it's a good idea to read through the high level overview of the system.

<p>
  If you're not familiar with Vue, make sure to check out the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html">Vue docs</a> before getting started.
  Note that there is nothing inherently tying Graffiti to Vue, it just happens to be the first framework we added support for.
  If you're interested in make a Graffiti plugin for a different web framework, please <a href="mailto:graffiti@mit.edu">contact us</a> or make a pull request.

  This guide includes a number of interactive demos, like the one below. The included source code can be modified and the demo will update dynamically.
