  ActivityPub: is a blend of Email and RSS, plus your Email/RSS reader is also your admin. Tendency to centralize, still a small handful of adversaries. Not flexible in terms of context: 
  ActivityPub does give users a lot of control, for example owners of a particular ActivityPub instance can moderate that server.
  However, as mentioned in Why? many communities collapsed - self hosting is hard, it's hard to know "where to be".
  Additionally, ActivityPub is fairly constrained to stream-based social media - it is essentially a combination of email and RSS.
  there are posts "in your inbox" or "in someoneone else's outbox" or in the inbox/outbox of your server.
  Some of those get routed to things like comment threads, but for the most part it is

  Spritely: is a federated social media project spearheaded by ActivityPub coauthor Christine.
  Spritely is largely working on a problem orthogonal to what we've studied with Graffiti: security.
  A major problem with Graffiti is that when you log in to an application it has access to everything: reading private messages, creating changing and deleting content.
  Object Capability Security, one of the foundations of Spritely works on Principle of Least Authority.
  This means that you could run an application from someone you've never heard of and not be afraid of it stealing all your data.
  (Perhaps let's collab )

  Solid: You create your own pod, other people

  Matrix: combines many messaging systems. Room based - can't query over the network.

  Gobo.social, daniel jackson thing, etc. these take one specific access of social networks and provide levers for it. Daniel jackson gives. These do not give complete freedom. These and other projects would be a great use of things to build on top of Graffiti. Essentially making low-code design tools that cover some of the most common use cases.
  These design tools could grow and evolve just like any other applications.
