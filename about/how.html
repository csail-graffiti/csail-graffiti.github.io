  Graffiti is like big bucket that anyone can place social "objects" into.
  These objects can represent posts, profiles, or anything anyone might make up - there's no enforced schema - how about objects to represent X or Y.
</p>

<p>
  Objects can also reference other objects: a like object might reference the post object it is liking; a friend object might references the two profile objects it is forming a relationship between.
  <!--This design is inherited from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> and one of it's realizations, ActivityStreams (which underlies ActivityPub, which underlies Mastodon).-->

<p>
  Different applications can be built by pulling different sets of objects out of the bucket.
  To construct something like Twitter, I could look through the bucket for objects that answer:
  Who am I friends with?
  What posts have those friends made recently?
  Who has liked those posts?
  To construct something different like Yelp I could ask:
  What restaurants are near me?
  What have people said about those restaurants?
</p>

<p>
  Once I have pulled out the appropriate of the bucket, it is entirely up to me to choose how I want to organize and display them.
  I could sort the posts chronologically, by each post's like count, or by some machine learning algorithm.
  Maybe I display a like count with each post, or I could only display some profile to make it less of a popularity contest.
<p>

<p>
  In a world where everyone thinks and feels the same, perhaps this bucket analogy would be enough to create a zoo of different social applications that all interoperate.
  But in a reality we need to deal with a critical : social boundaries.
  Some people hear things that they wish weren't said, and some people say things that they wish weren't widely heard.
  We're going to look at three essential ways that people define maintain their social boundaries: moderation, access control, and context,
  We're also going to discuss how what properties Graffiti has that enables people to have these boundaries even if their's aren't the same as someone else's.
</p>

<h2>
  Moderation
</h2>

<p>
  Flagging, issuing warnings, muting, "downvoting to oblivion",
  Some forms of moderation are destructive and others aren't: banning, deleting content.
  Sometimes change what people can see: ban lists, etc.
  Others remove content entirely.
  We will call the first moderation and the second censorship.
</p>

You may disagree with this distinction. Many things that are routinely called moderation, we're calling censorship. For example, "removed by moderator" on Reddit.
One alternative would be for the moderator to 

<p>
  In Graffiti, no censorship other than self-censorship, is allowed.
  In other words, no user can modify or delete anyone elses's content, although they can modify and delete their own content.
  However, this can enable any sort of moderation to take place.
</p>

<p>
  One way would be for self-appointed moderators to create "Block" objects that, in the same way as "Like" objects, refer to a particular post or other content.
  ["Bob is the worst."-Alice "This comment is mean." -Carol]
</p>

<p>
  Some people might choose to ignore these moderation signals others might listen to signals from trusted friends (>2 friends) and others might listen to signals from government agencies.

  Some might hide content, some might put it in a warning marker and some might put it in a place to go through when they're in the right headspace "Death Threats to forward to the police".
</p>

<p>
  For collaborative applications (google docs, wikis, games) actions can be put together with CRDTs.
  People can choose to ignore actions that people have taken.
</p>

<h2>
  Access Control
</h2>

<p>
  To create things like private messages you can add a set of recipients to
  These objects will only show up in queries by those recipients.
</p>

<p>
  You might make things only to yourself: drafts, bookmarks, read recipiepts.
</p>

<h2>
  Context
</h2>

<p>
  There are somethings that are technically public but intended for a specific audience.
  Think subreddit, your wall, comment thread.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes when these boundaries are broken.
  For example, Instagram used to have a "Following" tab where you could see all of the likes and comments your friends made.
  A parent interacting with adult content online may inadvertantly alert those actions to their children.
  Closeted gay people may accidentally out themselves to their coworkers.
  This is known as context collapse.
</p>

<p>
  We have our own way of doing it in Graffiti but to see why it's necessary consider something like "Rooms" or "Channels".
  You can do a lot: reference matrix plugin.
  For a fixed design, rooms can do about anything but they are sufficient for interoperation between apps.
</p>

<p>
  One thing someone might want to change about there app is context: maybe they want to make the context smaller, mayber larger, maybe change it completely.
  Which room do you post in?
  If I am looking to buy a used guitar do I look in the room for selling? my local community? music? selling music? selling-music-locally? ...
</p>

<p>
  Context can also be useful for applications with different features
  Post that has a sarcastic symbol, "only" want to show this to people
  who are looking for objects with that feature.
  Otherwise they'll just see something very out of context.
</p>

<p>
  Can be mixed with access control.
</p>

<h2>
  Implementation
</h2>

python, fastapi, websockets, mongodb. Front end Vue.
Big blobs (images, videos, audio) go on IPFS.

It is centralized and not encrypted.
Hopefully we can use searchable encryption access controlled content.

As for decentralization, some thoughts:
decentralization provides guarantees that "the ship won't sink" etc.
In this system, as little choices as possible are being made, and engineering is just going to be throughput - would running it as a cooperatively owned nonprofit be enough?
Alternatively one way to decentralize it would be to replicate the database across several different mirrors.
This wouldn't be like hosting a blockchain mirror - you'd be downloading all of people's posts!
Queries over a network are difficult.

Bots:
Some applications are highly state based: wikipedia,
Tallying a post that has thousands of likes,
Automatic meta data appended to content.
Having a bot.
Or alternatively having a bot do Y.
The bots could be randomly audited.
These bots could basically claim they are doing a particular task and.
Maybe there could be a language for these tasks - who knows!
maybe this is a place for smart contracts, although.
