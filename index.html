      Graffiti
    </h1>
    <p>
      lets you add custom social components to any static website with just a few lines of HTML and Javascript.
      These applications can be as simple as a comments section or as complicated as Facebook or Google Docs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Applications within the Graffiti ecosystem also <em>interoperate</em>.
      If your friends use a Graffiti application that you don't like, you can either modify it, create your own from scratch, or switch to an application that someone else has already built &mdash; all without losing your friends!
      You can change pretty much anything including the moderation system, privacy settings, feed sorting algorithm, site layout, color scheme, etc.
